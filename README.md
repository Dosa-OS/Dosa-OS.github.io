# Dosa OS
## NETWORK SECURITY ASSESSMENT & PENETRATION TESTING VIRTUAL MACHINE

This project is designed for network penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. We have focused on setting up various attack scenarios by developing a variety of tools that can be used to exploit a network’s weakness. We aim to create an operating system based on Debian specifically for penetration testing.
